1. Forking
	Forking is a way of creating a copy of the given repository so that it belongs to our user.

2. Pull request
	A commit or series of commits that you send to the owner of the repo so that they can incorporate it into their tree.

3. Patching a repo
	First fork the repo and make changes to the local branch
	Then create a pull request to the owner of the repo, it is upto the owner to decide whether to include your commits or not.

4. Suppose we want to combine all our changes into a single commit and submit a single pull request
	git rebase -i master
	An editor opens up and we can choose what to do with the commits, we can use squash the second commit here.

5. To see the commit graph type
	git log --graph --oneline

6. Force git to push current snapshot into git when there are merge conflicts
	git push -f

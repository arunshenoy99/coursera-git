1. Remote repos help alot in collaboration.

2. You modify local files, stage and commit them and then pull other changes from repo which are merged with your local repo and if there are conflicts then manually merge.

3. Check config or remote
	git remote -v

4. Get detailed info on repo
	git remote show <reponame>

5. Get branches in remote repo
	git branch -r

6. Get commit history from remote repo when local repo is out of date, this doesn not replce the local branch but rather just gives us the commits done on the remote branch
	git fetch
	git merge <fetchedbranch>
git fetch gets the commit history whereas git pull fetches and merges directly with the local repo

7. Fetch the most up to date objects
	git remote update

8. Push a branch to remote repo
	git push -u origin <branchname>

9 .To prevent a 3 way merge use
	goto remote repo
	use git rebase master
	comeback to master repo
	git merge <branchname>

10. Delete remote branch
	git push --delete origin <branchname>

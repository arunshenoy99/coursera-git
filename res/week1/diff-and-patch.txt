1. DIFF TOOL
	Gives the differences between two files.
	diff is used to find differences between two files. On its own, itâ€™s a bit hard to use; instead, use it with diff -u to find lines which differ in two files
	diff file1 file2 > new.diff
	diff -u is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output
	diff -u file1 file2 > new.diff
	diff file formats contain changes between two versions of a file
2. PATCH TOOL
	Takes a diff file and applies it to the old file
	patch file1 < new.diff

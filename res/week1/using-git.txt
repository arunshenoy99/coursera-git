1. TELL GIT WHO WE ARE
	git config --global user.email "devarunshenoy99@gmail.com"
	git config --global user.name "Arun"

2. CREATE A NEW GIT REPO
	git init
	CREATES .git WHICH IS LIKE A DATABASE TO STORE CHANGES TO YOUR REPO(OLDER VERSIONS)
	FILES OUTSIDE .git ARE KNOWN AS WORKING TREE AND CONTAINS THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE FILES

3. TRACK THE FILES
	git add filename
	ADDS FILE TO STAGING AREA(INDEX) WHICH IS A FILE MAINTAINED BY GIT THAT CONTAINS ALL OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO GO INTO YOUR NEXT COMMIT

4. GET THE STATUS OF WORKING TREE
	git status

5. COMMIT THE CHANGES 
	git commit
	OPENS TEXT EDITOR FOR A COMMIT MESSAGE AND COMMITS

6. UNTRACKED -> STAGED -> TRACKED -> COMMITED
   TRACKED -> MODIFIED -> STAGED -> COMMITED
   WORKING TREE -> STAGING AREA -> REPO/COMMIT

7. CHECK CURRENT CONFIG
	git config -l

8. ANATOMY OF A COMMIT MESSAGE
	ALWAYS KEEP YOUR COMMIT MESSAGES BELOW 72 WORDS AND DONT TYPE STUFF LIKE FIXED BUGS, UPDATED FILE ETC

9. VIEWING COMMITS
	git log
